QUES :: what is synchronous vs asynchronous ?
ANS :: * Synchronous programming is good for simple, step-by-step tasks.
* Asynchronous programming is ideal for situations where the program 
needs to be responsive and handle multiple operations efficiently, 
especially when dealing with tasks that take a long time to complete.
