Q: what are middlewares,
sol: Middleware functions in Node.js are functions that handle requests and responses in the application's request-response cycle. They can:

- Execute any code.
- Modify request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects.
- End the request-response cycle by sending a response.
- Pass control to the next middleware function using `next()`.
